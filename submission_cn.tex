\item Title of Course Notes: Linear Algebra: Notes and Problems

\item Abstract: This set of notes and problems covers a junior-level linear algebra course (following an introduction to proof course) with broad chapter topics of 1) efficiently solving systems of linear equations, 2) vector spaces, 3) connecting ideas (dimension, invertibility, and eigenvalues), and 4) inner product spaces. The approach of these notes is a blend of computational and sense-making problems, as well as an increasing usage of conjecture and proof throughout the course.

\item History of Use: These notes have been used by two faculty members in five sections of the junior-level linear algebra course at SFASU over a four year period.
